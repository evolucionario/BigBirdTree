Trees were inferred with iqtree v2.07 (Compute Canada, cedar)

NOTES:
Multisequence alignments generated from PyPHLAWD Markov clustering of all-by-all blast analyses
These are 'dirty' inferences (essentially inference using _all_ possible data):
  - all genes that pass the minimum requirements of length and taxon coverage are used
    - these include some genes that are gappy (poorly aligned) or restricted to too few taxa
  - all taxa from NCBI are used
    - these include hybrids, sp. taxa, etc.
All trees inferred using a partitioned model, where each partition is modelled with GTR+G
No topological constraints were employed
All tree are unrooted
These trees will be updated as alignments/models are finalized


TODO:
1. get rid of excessively gappy partitions
2. prune out bad taxa
3. infer partition-specific substitution models (possibly find best partitioning strategy)
4. compare likelihoods of unconstrained trees are trees constrained to (IOC) taxonomy
5. programmatically root trees given relationships
  - this is necessary for subsequent dating
